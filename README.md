There are reports that one in five web users have installed software to strip advertising from web pages. And who can blame them? We all have cursed at an unwanted and invasive ad one time or another. But what a content creator with ads on his/her pages to do? In this talk, I will look at trends and what hacks, tricks and tools are available. ​

Presenter: Daigo Fujiwara (@DaigoFuji) is a front-end web developer at WBUR-FM, Boston's NPR News Satation (wbur.org), and founder/organizer of Baseball Hack Day. He has previously worked at The Boston Globe, Harvard Business Review, Christian Science Monitor, Inc Magazine and Fast Company Magazine.​
